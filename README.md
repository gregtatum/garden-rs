# Garden

This is an experiment in designing a distributed connected garden experience. It started as an implementation of a blockchain, but has moved on to be a bit more than that. There is no proof of work like a cryptocurrency, but plays with the idea of a distributed consensus-building system.

 - [x] Build a block chain implementation.
 - [x] Serialize the block chain to a store.
 - [x] Remove proof of work.
 - [x] Create a garden struct.
 - [x] Create a peer to peer network to share block chains.
 - [ ] Visualize the garden using text art.
 - [ ] Create a reconciliation algorithm for connecting gardens.
 - [ ] Add the ability to plant things in the garden and watch them grow.
 - [ ] Add more advanced ideas for interacting with the garden, and make them backwards compatible.
 - [ ] Explore options on opening up the p2p network to beyond just your local network.
 - [ ] Moderate garden connection requests.
 - [ ] Explore real-time interactions
